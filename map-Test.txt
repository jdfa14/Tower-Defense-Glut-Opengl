# ignore this line
# some coments
# with % you will say what letter to map to what name of file in extention .bmp
# in format % [char] [name] 
# and one per line for example:
% d path1 #right edge
% f path2 #middle path
% g path3 # left edge
% v path4 # down edge
% r path5 # up edge
% t path6 # out corner ur
% e path7 # out corner ul
% b path8 # out corner dr
% c path9 # out corner dl
% u path6 # in corner ur
% y path7 # in corner ul
% j path8 # in corner dr
% h path9 # in corner dl
% q rock1 #big rock up right
% w rock2 #and so on, comments are not needed
% a rock3 
% s rock4 
% x rock5 #lonely little rock


# Next ones MUST ever been included

% D default #default will not be mapped in the text file, but will use this image for spaces
% S path2 # will be used to mark the start of the path
% E path2 # will be used to mark the end of the path
# numbers will be used to the next point from 0-9 where S = 0 and E = (0..9)
% N path2 # N will be used for whateva number


# the map must be 25 * 50 and will be used two or more of them
# one for the sprites, another for the path of movement and placeable sprites
# the @ will be used to mark the start and the end of the map and ! the end of the line
